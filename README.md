Responsive webpage design for fictional company


This project is part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Bootcamp. This project is the capstone project for the HTML and CSS learning units, and focuses on responsive design. I have included responisve CSS code so that the webpage does not lose functionality and design when shrunk or viewed on mobile devices.
